## Interface Changes

### High level interface
 - High level interface is now standardized across compressor formats. 
 - This interface provides a single nvcompManagerBase object that
 can do compression and decompression. Users can now decompress nvcomp-compressed
 files without knowing how they were compressed. The interface also can manage scratch space 
 and splitting the input buffer into independent chunks for parallel processing.

### API Consolidation
 - nvCOMP now supports only the low-level batch API and the new high level interface

# nvcomp 2.1.0 (2021-10-28)

## New Features
 - New release of low-level batched API for Cascaded and Bitcomp methods.
 - New high-throughput and high-compression-ratio GPU compressors in GDeflate

## Interface Changes
 - Update batched/low-level compression interfaces to take an options parameter,
 to allow configuring future compression algorithms.
 - Update batched/low-level decompression interfaces to output the decompressed
 size (or 0 if an error occurs).
 - Add bounds checking to batched/low-level decompression routines, such that
 if an invalid compressed data stream is provided, 0 will be written for the
 output size, rather than generating an illegal memory access.
 - Fix LZ4 to support chunk sizes < 32 KB. 

## Performance Optimizations
 - Improve performance of Snappy compression by ~10% in some configurations.
 - Add an optimization to the LZ4 compressor based on specification of input data as
 char, short, or int, rather than just treating the input as raw bytes. 
 - Optimization to reduce the LZ hash table size when compressing smaller chunks.
 - Improved compression performance in GDeflate with the high-throughput option
 - Improved decompression performance in GDeflate (10-75% depending on the dataset)

## Bug Fixes
 - Fix LZ4 CPU compression example.
 - Fix temp allocation size bug in `benchmark_template_chunked`.

## Infrastructure
 - Update CMakeLists to compile nvcomp with -fPIC enabled.
 - Add a new script for benchmarking compression algorithms.
 - Add unit tests for the Snappy decompressor that tests decompression on legally
 formatted files that won't be generated by the nvcomp compressor due to 
 configuration.
 - Update CMakeLists to suppress warnings about missing nvcomp external dependencies
 when the user didn't indicate they wanted to include them.
 - Update CMakeLists to allow install into include folder that the user does not have 
 ownership of.
